 ```For The Future You```
 
## Inspiration
There are several ways in which people try to promote fitness and wellness in today’s world. A plethora of outdoor activities and social gatherings can contribute to each person's well-being. 
However, on all these occasions often there is a population that is overlooked or forgotten. However, they are the ones that require the most help, physically or mentally. These are our elderly people.
In this modern era, people are becoming busier and more attached to work. Many children grow up and choose to work or study away from home. The older folks are often left behind and feel disconnected from society. They lack social interaction, which has led them to create a false belief of not being appreciated.
This situation worsened due to the global pandemic, having many restrictions imposed on elder people.
They often have limited regenerative abilities and are more susceptible than younger individuals to diseases, syndromes, injury and illness.
Especially, in the wake of a technological world, these folks frequently feel left out.
Depression and inferiority complex increases when one steps into senility and this is often aggravated with loneliness and an unhealthy lifestyle.
This is a BIG problem!
So here is something that can support our old people.. the future of us!

## What it does
My SeniorPal app helps seniors enhance their emotional and physical well-being. One important element in preserving physical well-being is activities such as exercise or yoga. The irony, though, is that if not correctly done, they might bring harm rather than a benefit. The posture and breath must be right while doing these. However, having one to one instructors for each individual might be expensive and not affordable for each person. We have a solution for that too. UI of our app is so simple that it could be easily used by someone who is a newbie in the technical field. Now more into our solution.
 
With the help of machine learning, our app gives instructions to the person for correcting their posture and to monitor if the exercises are done properly.
It also gives reminders for the correct time before and after the workout for drinking water and consuming food. This is particularly crucial because most of the old population suffer from a loss of memory.
Old people often feel ignored and secluded, when they are alone. And might not be able to meetups or gather with their friends or make new friends. To tackle this, my app provides a solution by helping them meet up with people of their age. They’ll have virtual group meetings, where each one of them can share their experiences, life stories and inspirational talks. This can immensely help the ones who are feeling lonely and left out. There is also an option that helps them to connect with like-minded people and to develop new hobbies.

## How I built it
To correct the postures of the users, I have used a deep learning technique.
The neural network is trained with several images of people doing exercise and yoga. The camera on the user’s device captures the posture of the user every second and the model analyses the posture of the person. The app analyses the differences in the user’s posture and the correct posture and instructs the user accordingly. 


## Challenges I ran into
Implementing a deep neural network that could accurately recognize every single posture in exercise and yoga was challenging. 

## Accomplishments that I’m proud of
I am delighted to develop something that numerous elderly folks who are typically overlooked might benefit from. Till now, there is no physical and mental well-being app that targets the elderly population and are customized specifically for them. What we often forget is that each one of us is going to enter that phase sooner or later. I’m so proud that I could develop something that could benefit and represent one of the most overlooked populations.

## What I learned
I have learned about deep learning and computer vision techniques. I have also understood the relevance of having enough data in machine learning problems. I have also studied in-depth about the problems that are being faced by the older population, particularly that of depression, solitude and physical weakness.

## What's next for SENIOR PAL
I aim to incorporate various other features that could benefit these people. Such as correcting their posture while performing various tests (blood test, pressure check etc). If these tests are not taken in the correct posture, the outputs might vary and this might introduce a reason for another depression!  I’m also planning to implement a feature to help them to take shots accurately. Often these people have to take injections like insulin on their own. With the help of machine learning, we can instruct the users to find the accurate place, where the shots are supposed to be given.
